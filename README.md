# Data-visualization

“Visualization gives you answers to questions you didn’t know you had.”

– Ben Schneiderman

Data visualization is the art of presenting complex and unorganized data in a form that everyone can easily understand and analyze. Where it is a mammoth task with a lot of data, these visualizations in maps, charts, and graphs become more important.                    

There are more ways to visualize, This is all about visualization using Python.  

Visualizations include:-

1- **Choropleth map** : A choropleth map is a thematic map that is used to represent statistical data using the color mapping symbology technique. It displays enumeration units, or divided geographical areas or regions that are colored, shaded or patterned in relation to a data variable.

2- **Heat map** : A heatmap (aka heat map) depicts values for a main variable of interest across two axis variables as a grid of colored squares. The axis variables are divided into ranges like a bar chart or histogram, and each cell's color indicates the value of the main variable in the corresponding cell range.

3- **Bubble chart** : A bubble chart (aka bubble plot) is an extension of the scatter plot used to look at relationships between three numeric variables. Each dot in a bubble chart corresponds with a single data point, and the variables' values for each point are indicated by horizontal position, vertical position, and dot size.

4- **Histogram** : A histogram is a graph that shows the frequency of numerical data using rectangles. The height of a rectangle (the vertical axis) represents the distribution frequency of a variable (the amount, or how often that variable appears).
